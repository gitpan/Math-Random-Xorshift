Math-Random-Xorshift version 0.01
=================================

REQUIREMENTS

Exporter::Lite is required. Test::UseAllModules and Test::Exception are also required for testing.

This module uses XS. So you will need a C compiler to build.
I'm using Perl 5.10.1 and GCC 4.2.1 for developing though, you will be able to
build on Perl 5.8 too.

INSTALLATION

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
