=head1 NAME

Math::Random::Xorshift - a fast PRNG

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 my @seeds = (123_456_789, 362_436_069, 521_288_629, 88_675_123);
 
 # OO interface
 use Math::Random::Xorshift;
 my $rng = Math::Random::Xorshift->new(@seeds);
 $rng->srand(@seeds);
 my $n = $rng->rand;
 my $i = $rng->irand;
 
 # Functional interface
 use Math::Random::Xorshift qw/srand irand rand/;
 srand(@seeds);
 $n = rand(10);
 $i = irand;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is a straight forward implementation of Xorshift PRNG proposed by G. Marsaglia in 2003.

Note that the algorithm is extremely fast and passes the L<Diehard test|http://www.stat.fsu.edu/pub/diehard/> though, is not reliable enough statistically (see L</SEE ALSO> section). I think however this module is useful for games and suchlike usages.

If you want rather more reliability than fastness, I recommend L<Math::Random::MT>.

=head2 EXPORT

None by default. You can import C<srand>, C<rand> and C<irand> to replace Perl's builtins. These functions manupilate static PRNG object in C level. So these are about 3-4x faster than OO interface, since there's no method resolution overhead.

=head1 METHOD

=head2 new([$seed | @seeds])

Constructor. You can specify up to 4 seed(s). At least 1 seed value must not be zero.
If no seeds are given, return value of C<time(3)> is used.

=head2 srand([$seed | @seeds])

Resets seeds.

=head2 irand()

Returns unsigned random integer in range of [0, UINT32_MAX).

=head2 rand([$upper_limit = 1.0])

Returns random real number in range of [0, $upper_limit). C<$upper_limit> should be positive.

=head1 BENCHMARK

Here is a benchmark result on my Macbook(Core 2 Duo 2.4 GHz/4GB DDR3 RAM).
Competitors are L<Math::Random::MT>, L<Math::Random::ISAAC>, and Perl's builtin C<rand()>.

You can run bench.pl included in this distribution to benchmark on your machine.
